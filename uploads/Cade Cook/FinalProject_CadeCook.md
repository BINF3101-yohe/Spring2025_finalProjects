Physical size of your virus, and how does this compare to the size of a human cell and SARS-CoV-2?

The sizes of the virus vary, but it tends to range from 60 to 300nm in diameter, which is larger than SARS-CoV-2, though smaller than most human cells.

What is the shape of your virus, and does it have an envelope?

The shape of the Bear Canyon virus is spherical, and it does have an envelope.

When was your virus first described? When was the last outbreak?

The Bear Canyon virus was first discovered in 1998. The last known outbreak is unknown since the virus affects rodents rather than humans, so most cases have not been recorded.

What does your virus infect? Is it specific to a particular host, or is it more general?

This virus infects rodents and has mostly been found in mice.

How does your virus penetrate the cell?

I could not find any sources specifically stating how the Bear Canyon Virus enters a host cell, but this virus is part of the Mammarenavirus genus, and research has shown that it acts similarly to arenaviruses. Assuming this is true, it can be inferred that the Bear Canyon Virus uses its surface glycoprotein complex to attach to host cell receptors and then enters through receptor-mediated endocytosis.

How does your virus replicate? Does it have its own genetic machinery, or does it hijack its host?

We are still not fully sure how the Bear Canyon virus replicates, but as an arenavirus and a single-stranded RNA virus, we can assume how it replicates. Knowing that it is a single-stranded RNA virus, we know it can not use its own genome as mRNA, so it needs to hijack a host cell. Once again, assuming that the Bear Canyon virus replicates like most arenaviruses, we can assume that after entering the cell, it initiates transcription using the host mRNAs. The viral mRNAs will then be translated by the host and replicate viral proteins.

Describe how your virus gets released into the cell. Does it kill the cell, bud from the host cell, or is it excreted by the host cell?

Like other arenaviruses, the Bear Canyon virus gets released through budding from the plasma membrane. This process does not usually kill the host cell.

Does your virus show any signs of latency?

There have been signs of no true latency with the Bear Canyon virus, and it is believed to maintain a long-term infection with ongoing replication within mice.

Is your virus considered in equilibrium with humans? Does it show any antigenic shift?

As of right now, there have been no signs of equilibrium with humans, and the Bear Canyon virus has only been shown to infect mice. Also, there has been no sign found for antigenic shift, and the virus instead shows signs of genetic stability.

Are there any vaccines available for your virus? What is the mechanism underlying the vaccine? 

There are no current vaccines for the Bear Canyon virus, most likely because it does not infect humans and is nonlethal to its actual host.

Are any anti-viral drugs available for your virus? How do they work?

There are no current anti-viral drugs specifically for the Bear Canyon virus, but there are anti-viral drugs for other arenaviruses, such as ribavirin. This drug attacks certain arenaviruses by increasing the mutation rate in the genome.

## Hydrophobicity Comparison Plot

Here’s my hydrophobicity plot comparing E. coli and Bear Canyon Virus:

![Hydrophobicity Comparison](hydrophobicity_comparison.png)

---

N=6,051 E. coli proteins, with mean μ=0.04±0.15

N=1 Bear Canyon Virus protein, with mean μ=−0.01±0.00

The Bear Canyon Virus has an average hydrophobicity slightly below zero, sitting right at the 
main E. coli distribution peak, meaning it’s roughly similar in hydrophobic profile to most E. coli 
proteins.

Outlier: ID: AY924390.1, ORF: 1  
I identified the most hydrophobic protein in Bear Canyon Virus as an RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp; NCBI RefSeq YP_001649225.1). This enzyme plays a central role in 
replicating the viral RNA genome and is critical for the viral life cycle. Although RdRp does not 
directly mediate viral entry, its activity is essential after entry, supporting genome replication and 
transcription. Its hydrophobic regions might reflect interactions within the replication complex or 
membrane-associated processes.
