# Introduction

- **Viral classification:**  
  - *ICTV classification*: [Insert ICTV classification here with citation].  
  - *Baltimore classification*: [Insert Baltimore group and explanation here][6][8].

- **Physical size:**  
  - The physical size of [your virus] is approximately XX nm, which is [smaller/larger] than a typical human cell (~10,000 nm) and [smaller/larger] than SARS-CoV-2 (~120 nm) [insert citation].

- **Shape and envelope:**  
  - The virus exhibits a [describe shape, e.g., icosahedral, helical, complex] morphology and [does/does not] possess an envelope [insert citation].

- **Discovery and outbreaks:**  
  - [Your virus] was first described in [year] [insert citation]. The most recent outbreak occurred in [year/location] [insert citation].

- **Host range:**  
  - This virus infects [host(s)], and is [host-specific/generalist] [insert citation].

- **Cell entry:**  
  - The virus penetrates the host cell via [mechanism, e.g., endocytosis, membrane fusion, receptor-mediated entry] [insert citation].

- **Replication strategy:**  
  - [Your virus] [has its own replication machinery/relies on host machinery] and replicates by [describe process] [insert citation].

- **Release mechanism:**  
  - Viral progeny are released by [cell lysis, budding, excretion, etc.] [insert citation].

- **Latency:**  
  - [State if the virus shows latency and describe, or state if not] [insert citation].

- **Equilibrium and antigenic shift:**  
  - [Discuss if the virus is in equilibrium with humans and if it shows antigenic shift] [insert citation].

- **Vaccines:**  
  - [State if vaccines are available, type/mechanism of vaccine] [insert citation].

- **Antiviral drugs:**  
  - [List available antivirals and their mechanisms] [insert citation].
